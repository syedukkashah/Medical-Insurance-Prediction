##Project Overview
The "Medical Insurance Prediction System" is a comprehensive machine learning application developed to predict the cost of medical insurance based on user-provided demographic, lifestyle, and health-related information. This project combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a visually appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter. The system integrates data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and visualization to provide an intuitive user experience.

This project is designed for educational purposes as part of the Fall 2024 AI and Programming curriculum, showcasing how machine learning can be seamlessly integrated into a functional and user-friendly application. The project also emphasizes practical implementations of machine learning concepts and GUI design principles in Python.

#Key Features
Machine Learning Integration:

Uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict medical insurance costs.
Supports feature preprocessing pipelines to handle categorical and numerical data effectively.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Built using Python's Tkinter library.
Provides a responsive and scrollable interface for users to input details, visualize data, and interact with the system.
Logo and Branding:

Includes a customizable logo displayed prominently in the application.
Ensures branding consistency for academic or professional purposes.
Data Input:

Users can input information such as age, BMI, smoking status, gender, number of dependents, and region.
Fields include validation to ensure data accuracy.
Predictive Output:

After data entry, the system calculates and displays the predicted insurance cost.
#Data Visualization:

Allows users to upload datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Generates charts such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms for better insight into the data.

#Error Handling:

Includes robust exception handling to notify users of issues like file loading errors (e.g., missing or corrupted logo) or invalid inputs.

#Technologies Used
Tkinter: For building the user interface.
Pillow (PIL): For image processing and displaying the application's logo.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and preprocessing.
pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
